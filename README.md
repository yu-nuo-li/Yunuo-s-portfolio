# [Project 1: The Impact of Various Socio-economic Factors on COVID-19 Vaccination Rate](https://github.com/yu-nuo-li/Impact-of-Various-Socioeconomic-Factors-on-COVID-19-Vaccination-Rate)

This project was completed for my Computational Methods course, where we examined the relationship between socio-economic factors and COVID-19 vaccination rates across the United States. The goal was to gain a deeper understanding of how demographic and economic conditions collectively influence vaccination behavior amid the rapid spread of the virus. Using non-parametric statistical methods in R, we found that poverty levels, state Medicaid expansion status, and racial and ethnic composition significantly impacted vaccination rates, which highlights the persistent challenges of achieving equitable public health outcomes during a global crisis.
