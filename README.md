# [Project 1: Impact of Various Socio-economic Factors on COVID-19 Vaccination Rate](https://github.com/yu-nuo-li/Impact-of-Various-Socioeconomic-Factors-on-COVID-19-Vaccination-Rate)

This project was completed for my Computational Methods course, where we examined the relationship between socio-economic factors and COVID-19 vaccination rates across the United States. The goal was to gain a deeper understanding of how demographic and economic conditions collectively influence vaccination behavior amid the rapid spread of the virus. Using non-parametric statistical methods in R, we found that poverty levels, state Medicaid expansion status, and racial and ethnic composition significantly impacted vaccination rates, which highlights the persistent challenges of achieving equitable public health outcomes during a global crisis.

# [Project 2: Pricing Mechanism of Airbnb Listing Price in Los Angeles](https://github.com/zhou-zoe-xiaoli/Pricing-Mechanism-of-Airbnb-Listing-Price-in-Los-Angeles)

This project was completed for my Bayesian Data Analysis course in collaboration with @zhou-zoe-xiaoli. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical model to identify key factors influencing Airbnb listing prices in Los Angeles, building upon prior research on pricing determinants. The goal was to develop an in-depth understanding of the pricing strategies that support Airbnb’s continued growth. By integrating linear regression, a Gaussian process, and feature selection, our model captured both global and neighborhood-level effects on pricing. The analysis revealed that reputation and property composition significantly influence listing prices, while geographic location and local property characteristics account for price variation across neighborhoods, highlighting the complex spatial dynamics shaping Airbnb’s pricing mechanisms.

# [Project 3: Predicting Tesla Stock Prices Using Archived Tweets](https://github.com/yu-nuo-li/Predicting-Tesla-Stock-Prices-Using-X-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis)

This project examines how public sentiment on X (formerly Twitter) affects Tesla’s stock performance, addressing the challenge of anticipating market shifts driven by investor mood. Using over 3 million tweets (2018–2020) and historical stock data, we applied TextBlob, VADER, and machine learning models including LSTM, SVM, Random Forest, and Linear Regression to predict stock trends. The Random Forest model achieved the best directional accuracy while LSTM captured longer-term trends. This show that social media sentiment can enhance traditional forecasting methods. Future improvements include integrating sFinBERT, news sentiment, and macroeconomic indicators to boost accuracy and real-time performance.
